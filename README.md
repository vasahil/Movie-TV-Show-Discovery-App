<b>Experience While Building the App</b>

     Building this app was a great hands-on experience in:

      1. Working with real-world APIs

      2. Using RxJava Single.zip() for parallel API calls

      3. Implementing MVVM architecture properly

      4. Managing UI states using a sealed class (ResultState)

      5. Applying Clean Architecture principles by separating:

      6. DTOs (API layer)

      7. Domain models (UI/business layer)

      8. UI models (Compose layer)

      9. It helped me understand how professional Android apps manage data flow, error handling, and UI rendering.
